Narrowband Communications
Gateway: 4G Rugged Gateway
The 4G Rugged Gateway is an outdoor LoRa gateway featuring 4G and Ethernet backhaul connectivity. It serves as the core communication hub for Worldsensing edge devices, efficiently connecting a high volume of end devices and managing millions of bidirectional messages daily.

The 4G Rugged Gateway is a key component for Worldsensing’s narrowband networks
Provides connectivity in areas without internet coverage using LoRa/LoRaWAN radio communications
Supports private, single-network local deployments and redundant, multi-network cloud deployments with Worldsensing’s CMT software.
4G Rugged Gateway Cloud
Set up multi-gateway networks for data redundancy: if one gateway fails, data is routed through alternative gateways to CMT Cloud. Manage all networks, devices, and data from a single interface in CMT Cloud.
4G Rugged Gateway Edge
Operate your network, device and data locally via ethernet or 4G using the embedded CMT Edge. Compatible with the K20 Edge Repeater in the 863-874.4MHz (EMEA, India) and 915-928MHz (APAC, Latin America) bands for extended radio range.
4G Rugged Gateway Edge 915R
Operate your network, device and data locally via ethernet or 4G using the embedded CMT Edge. Compatible with the K20 Edge Repeater 915R for extended radio range in the 902-928MHz (North America) radio band.

K20 Edge Repeater
The repeater retransmits data from its associated nodes to the main gateway. Data can travel along multiple repeaters in hops before arriving at the main gateway, thus gaining significant longer range.
The K20 Edge Repeater extends the network range of single-net deployments
Field-proven tree network technology which has been tested for both straight and curved tunnels in underground mines
Up to 10 km of radio coverage for underground monitoring systems
Compared to other network topologies, long-range LoRa Tree topology offers the longest radio range in underground environments
